[{"authors":["author"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a PhD candidate at the Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota. My research focuses on strategic communication and enhancing individuals\u0026rsquo; ability to discern quality information, especially in the context of AI-driven disinformation. I explore interventions to counter mis/disinformation on social media across various contexts, including public relations, politics, and health. Additionally, I study people\u0026rsquo;s experiences with corrections—whether witnessing, performing, or receiving them. As a mixed-methods researcher, I use both qualitative approaches, like interviews, and quantitative methods, such as experiments and surveys. I am also deeply passionate about teaching. At the Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota, I have served as instructor of record for undergraduate courses, including JOUR 1501 Digital Games (online) in both Summer 2024 and Summer 2025 and JOUR 4259 Strategic Communication Case Analysis (in person) in Spring 2025.\nHere are my Email, Twitter, and Google Scholar.
